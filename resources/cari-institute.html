                <dd>The Consumer Aesthetics Research Institute is a collective association of researchers and designers dedicated to carrying on the important work of categorizing "consumer aesthetics" from the late mid-century, when work on the subject somewhat trailed off, through today. The cyclical relationship between a culture's collective attitudes and the visual qualities of the artifacts it generates is crucial to observe and consider both when attempting to create timely, meaningful artwork and when analyzing the social and economic events of the last half century. CARI is a nonprofit online institute with hundreds of members and contributors.</dd>
